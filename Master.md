# Viewing Functions Through Linear Algebra

A large portion of this course uses vectors to describe the quantum states that exist within a system. 

In quantum chemistry, it was established that a wavefunction is a complete discription of a particle's properties. This may include, but
is not limited to, the momentum, position, and kinetic energy of a particle within a system. Another vital component discussed was the 
operator, which describes the observable property of a particle (i.e. momentum, position, angular momemtun, spin, etc.). For every 
observable exists an operator which extracts the needed information from the particle's wavefunction. 

These principles can be applied to the Schrodinger equation: Hψ(x)=Eψ(x) where the possible measurement results in a set of eigenvalues.
There, the HH is the Hamiltonian operator.
For every eigenvalue obtained, there must also exist a definitively defined state. 

The equation that describes quantum mechanics of particles in well defined energy states can be determined by the time independent 
Schrödinger Equation, Ψ(x)Ψ(x).

The time dependent Schrödinger describes all physically realizable states, 
and is defined by the equation: \begin{equation}\label{tdse} \mathcal{H}\Psi(x,t) = E\Psi(x,t) \end{equation} 
where $$\mathcal{H}$$ is the Hamiltonian operator formed 
by the sum of the potential and kinetic energy operators, and $$\Psi(x,t)$$ is a time- and space-dependent wavefunction.


# The Particle In The Box

The Particle in a Box (PIB) describes some particle of mass, m that is confined between two walls at x = 0 and x = L: 
the potential energy is zero inside the box but rises abruptly to infinity at the "walls" or boundaries. This ensures that the 
observed particle *must* exist somewhere within the set boundaries.
This model is an idealization of the potential energy of a gas-phase molecule that is free to move in a one-dimensional container. 

# Observable States Of Particle

The operator used for a PIB system determines the physical state of the particle. For instance, operating with the kinetic energy 
operator will generate information of the particle's KE at different states of energy. Furthermore, the average kinertic energy could be 
calculated by finding the expectation value, or simply the average, based on the possible states the particle may exist. 


# The Time Independent Schrödinger Equation (TISE)

Unlike the TDSE, the time independent Schrodinger only depends on space and is indepdent of all time. To understand the properties
of any real quantum system we have to calculate the spacial and time dependent variables. This means that we have to find the 
complete wavefunction $\Psi(x,t)$.
The equation that describes the particles in a well defined energy state(s) or stationary state(s) can be deduced by the
following equation:
  \begin{equation}\label{tise}
    \mathcal{H}\psi(x)=E\psi(x)
\end{equation}
where $$\mathcal{H}$$ is the Hamiltonian operator that is the sum of the potential and kinetic energy operators, 
and $$\Psi(x)$$ is the time independent wavefunction.
The eigenvalues generated by the Hamilotian operator describe the energy level of a specific stationary state.
In order to solve for the TDSE, we must serarate the variables of space (postion) and time into their respective basis set:
<p align="center">  $\Psi(x,t)= \psi(x) T(t) $, </p>
where $\psi(x)$ is in the solution set for the TISE $\{ {\psi(x)}_n \}$.

*By investigating multiple well defined states, we are able to utilize MatLab to generate plots of wavefunctions that reflect the [TDSE](/MLW6.md) for a PIB*

These plots include: 
1. The wave function in the position basis over time in both real and imaginary axes
1. The wave function in the energy basis over time in both real and imaginary axes
1. The probability density of position in the real axis, while observing the expectation value and average energy
