### Complex Numbers


A complex number is a combination of a real and an imaginary number in the form  $w=a+ib$, where $i=\sqrt{-1}$. Specifically, a is the real number
and  b is the imaginary component. 
Complex numbers can be plotted as such on real and imaginary axis:

The complex conjugate of $w$, which is denoted as $w^* =a-ib$, is important in our future inquiries. The probability 
density: $|\psi|^2= \psi^* \psi$, where $\psi^* $ is the complex conjugate of the wavefunction, is an omnipresent feature in all TDSE
and TISE problems.

We can take this a step further and notate the complex number $z$ in polar coordinates as a function of $\theta$, the angle from 
the real axis, and $r$, the distance from the origin. Using polar coordinates, we have $w=re^{i\theta}$ as shown below:

We will be incorporating complex numbers into all of our MatLab calculations, as they provide us with a real foundation
to observe and probe quantum mechanical principles.
