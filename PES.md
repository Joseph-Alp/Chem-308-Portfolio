# Potential Energy Surfaces 

Because we are now able to observe bonding interactions on a quantum level, molecular dynamics can now be explored using quantum mechanics. We are now able to close out our semester long course by incorporating all we have learned into exploring molecular dynamics for a given particle(s) using the chemical equation: $$A + BC \rightarrow AB + C$$

Simulations based on quantum molecular dynamics make it possible to view experimental activity as it happens. We have seen the short comings of Classical Physics when trying to describe quantum mechanics throughout this course. To recap: Quantum molecular dynamics is  different from classical molecular dynamics, which is primarily concerned with the classical motion of atoms interacting with a given potential. We are interested in the subatomic activities occuring with a compound, where Newtn's Classical Laws do not fully explain what we are witnessing. Therefore, we can design a Matlab program that allows us to observe these subatomic interactions by observing the energy barriers a particle must overcome in order for $$A + BC \rightarrow AB + C$$ to take place. This reaction was studied using three different surfaces that represent different conditions; the first being an early barrier.


# Early Energy Barrier

An early barrier models the exothermic reaction taking place where the energy of the reactants are higher than the products. Despite being exothermic by its own nature, the reaction is not guarateed to happen. This is because a certain amount of energy is needed to get over the *"saddle point."* In this case, the saddle point is shifted to the right, as seen in the left graph. The right graph shows how the "slices" of the surface are the same as the potential well of binding for the products.
