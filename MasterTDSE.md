# The Time Dependent Schr√∂dinger Equation (TDSE)

Unlike the TISE, the time dependent Schrodinger only depends on space and of all time. To understand the properties
of any real quantum system we have to calculate the spacial and time dependent variables. This means that we have to find the 
complete wavefunction $\Psi(x,t)$.
The equation that describes the particles in a well defined energy state(s) or stationary state(s) can be deduced by the
following equation:
  \begin{equation}\label{tise}
    \mathcal{H}\psi(x)=E\psi(x)
\end{equation}
where $$\mathcal{H}$$ is the Hamiltonian operator that is the sum of the potential and kinetic energy operators, 
and $$\Psi(x)$$ is the time independent wavefunction.
The eigenvalues generated by the Hamilotian operator describe the energy level of a specific stationary state.
In order to solve for the TDSE, we must serarate the variables of space (postion) and time into their respective basis set:
<p align="center">  $\Psi(x,t)= \psi(x) T(t) $, </p>
where $\psi(x)$ is in the solution set for the TISE $\{ {\psi(x)}_n \}$.

Here, T(t) is always equal to $$e^{-i E_n t/\hbar}$$. As a result, the TDSE is rewritten in the form of: \begin{equation} \mathcal{H}\psi(x,t) = Psi(x,t)e^{-i E_n t/\hbar} \end{equation}. This is allowed only if the position and time variables are separated, as the energy eigenfunctions are defined as stationary.

*By investigating multiple well defined states, we are able to utilize MatLab to generate plots of wavefunctions that reflect the [TDSE](/MLW6.md) for a PIB*

These plots include: 
1. The wave function in the position basis over time in both real and imaginary axes
1. The wave function in the energy basis over time in both real and imaginary axes
1. The probability density of position in the real axis, while observing the expectation value and average energy


# Further Exploration 

Gaussian functions are often used to represent the probability density function of a normally distributed random variable. In our situation, we are able to observe the expectation value of energy in our TDSE PIB in [MatLab](/MLW6b.md). Here, we observe what should be expected: the expectation value plataus around the barriers where we see the effect of tunneling for our wave function.
