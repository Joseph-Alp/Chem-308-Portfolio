# Selection Rules

Since Quantum mechanics, we have been handed a set of "rules" termed the Selection Rules which is a formal representation of the constrains for the possible transitions of a system from one quantum state to another. Until now, these were a vague set of rules 
that didn't hold much merit in our studies. From a junior year perspective, selection rules were understood to have been derived for electromagnetic transitions in molecules and atoms. 

Given that the theme of this course is to go beyond what was taught in Statistical Thermodynamics and Quantum Chemistry, we explored the
foundation of Selection Rules, and viewed how they apply to our new insight. 

## Founded In Conservation

For the purpose of this course we will be taking the idea of conservation of energy, and extend it toward symmetry. For nearly every physics course, the idea that energy is conserved throughout a system has been an ingrained idea: the starting energy is always equal to the final energy. It turns out that these conservation laws are related to fundamental symmetries of physics. A symmetry means that you can do something that does not make a difference. For example, it would not matter where you would place a set of particles within an empty space (assuming nothing will affect the particles). Additionally, time symmetry can then denote energy conservation. We can apply this toward our quantum investigations as time-shift symmetry is built into the Schrodinger equation. The equation does not depend on what time it takes to become zero. Any solution of the equation can be shifted in time, assuming a Hamiltonian that does not depend explicitly on time.

# Practical Application

Selection Rules are not restricted to describing electromagnetic transitions for particles and atoms. They can be applied to a wide range of topics to discuss what transitions and conformations are permissible. Recently, we have focused on electric *dipole moments*, where there exists an oscillating electric field within our system. A very strong interaction within this system is between the diplole moment and light. Since we are interested in oscillating diplole moments, it's useful to bear in mind that we define our dipole moment as
*dipole moment = charge * displacement.* Although this describes a single dipole, any others that exist can be summed up using this formula. 


The oscillating dipole allows us to “take” the energy from the electromagnetic field to apply to some object. The sine wave model is used to show the propagation of an electromagnetic field, where the amplitude is representative of how vectors would represent the force a positive test charge would feel in the electromagnetic field. The sign indicates the direction, and the length of the vector indicates the magnitude of the field. In light of this, if the electric field yields some sort of net force, a torque is applies and the dipole rotates as it encounters the electromagnetic field.

# Orbitals 

A very useful application of what we have learned so far is to question if electron transitions occur within the context of atomic orbitals. Let's say we want to know if a transition from the 1s to 2px energy level is possible. Here is what we know from this scenario:
1. At out initial energy level (1s), we know the electron is quite close to the nucleus; therefore we can treat the dipole moment as zero
1. We know the electron cannot just teleport between states, there must exist a transition of some sort. Does this transition dipole moment then exist for our system? 

A transition dipole moment is a linear combination of the 1s and 2px AOs, where the probability of being in either energy level is not entirely known, and remains variable. In the previous section, we saw how constructive and destructive interferences can describe the AO interactions for H2. The side with constructive interference had a higher probability of existing in that state whereas the destructive interference side had significantly less. This tells us that we do infact have a dipole moment: our 1s and 2px are time evolving with their phase changes, with the 2p switching faster than the 1s- providing us with an oscullating dipole. This difference in the frequency of phase change for our energy states provide us with an oscillating transition. This phenomenon is not sequestered to just the 1s and 2px orbitals, but can be applied to all orbitals. 

Picture a 1s orbital and a 3d orbital. Could this transition take place? The 3d orbital is symmetric, where the position expectation value for our electron is close to the nucleus. No oscillating dipole exists for the 3d orbital, and therefore this transition is not allowed. This quantum realization is the foundation for the "filling in electrons" exercise in intro. chemistry. Selection Rules and oscillating transition dipoles are the fundamentals that explain a transition is allowed when it is energetically favored.
