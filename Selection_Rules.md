## Selection Rules

Since Quantum mechanics, we have been handed a set of "rules" termed the Selection Rules which is a formal representation of the constrains for the possible transitions of a system from one quantum state to another. Until now, these were a vague set of rules 
that didn't hold much merit in our studies due to their mystique. From a junior year perspective, selection rules were understood to have been derived for electromagnetic transitions in molecules and atoms. 

Given that the theme of this course is to go beyond what was taught in Statistical Thermodynamics and Quantum Chemistry, we explored the
foundation of Selection Rules, and viewed how they apply to our new insight.
