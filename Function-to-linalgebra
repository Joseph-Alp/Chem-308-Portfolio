# Viewing Functions Through Linear Algebra

A large portion of this course uses vectors to describe the quantum states that exist within a system. 

In quantum chemistry, it was established that a wavefunction is a complete discription of a particle's properties. This may include, but
is not limited to, the momentum, position, and kinetic energy of a particle within a system. Another vital component discussed was the 
operator, which describes the observable property of a particle (i.e. momentum, position, angular momemtun, spin, etc.). For every 
observable exists an operator which extracts the needed information from the particle's wavefunction. 

These principles can be applied to the Schrodinger equation: Hψ(x)=Eψ(x) where the possible measurement results in a set of eigenvalues.
There, the HH is the Hamiltonian operator.
For every eigenvalue obtained, there must also exist a definitively defined state. 

The equation that describes quantum mechanics of particles in well defined energy states can be determined by the time independent 
Schrödinger Equation, Ψ(x)Ψ(x).
