# Viewing Functions Through Linear Algebra

A large portion of this course uses vectors to describe the quantum states that exist within a system. 

In quantum chemistry, it was established that a wavefunction is a complete discription of a particle's properties. This may include, but
is not limited to, the momentum, position, and kinetic energy of a particle within a system. Another vital component discussed was the 
operator, which describes the observable property of a particle (i.e. momentum, position, angular momemtun, spin, etc.). For every 
observable exists an operator which extracts the needed information from the particle's wavefunction. 

These principles can be applied to the Schrodinger equation: Hψ(x)=Eψ(x) where the possible measurement results in a set of eigenvalues.
There, the HH is the Hamiltonian operator.
For every eigenvalue obtained, there must also exist a definitively defined state. 

The equation that describes quantum mechanics of particles in well defined energy states can be determined by the time independent 
Schrödinger Equation, Ψ(x)Ψ(x).

The time dependent Schrödinger describes all physically realizable states, 
and is defined by the equation: \begin{equation}\label{tdse} \mathcal{H}\Psi(x,t) = E\Psi(x,t) \end{equation} 
where $$\mathcal{H}$$ is the Hamiltonian operator formed 
by the sum of the potential and kinetic energy operators, and $$\Psi(x,t)$$ is a time- and space-dependent wavefunction.


# The Time Independent Schrödinger Equation (TISE)

The time independent Schrodinger only depends on space and is indepdent of all time. The equation that describes the 
particles in a well defined energy state(s) or stationary state(s) can be deduced by the following equation:
  \begin{equation}\label{tise}
    \mathcal{H}\psi(x)=E\psi(x)
\end{equation}
where $$\mathcal{H}$$ is the Hamiltonian operator that is the sum of the potential and kinetic energy operators, 
and $$\Psi(x)$$ is the time independent wavefunction.
The eigenvalues generated by the Hamilotian operator describe the energy level of a specific stationary state.
