This portfolio is a collection of physical chemistry projects completed throughout Chemistry 308: *Topics in Physical Chemistry*. Through a combination of programing on GitHub and MatLab, a heavy emphasis on probing topics in quantum chemistry via linear algebra is explored.

As the intended audience of this portfolio will ideally have a firm basis in linear algebra and complex numbers, please refer to the [tutorial](/Linear_Algebra_Basics.md) if a quick refresher on these topics is needed.  

This portfolio is separated into two areas: The quantum mechanical principles explained, and the MatLab code used to investigate their inqueries.
