This portfolio is a collection of physical chemistry projects completed throughout Chemistry 308: *Topics in Physical Chemistry*. Through a combination of programing on GitHub and MatLab, a heavy emphasis on probing topics in quantum chemistry via linear algebra is explored.

As MatLab requires a strong foundation in linear algebra and complex numbers, please refer to the [tutorial](/Linear_Algebra_Basics.md) if needed.  

This portfolio is separated into two areas: The quantum mechanical principles explained, and the MatLab code used to investigate the their inqueries. For all information pertaining to the background of quantum mechanical principles throughout Week 1 - Week 4, please see the [Master](/Master.md) with the following *table of contents*:

# Table of Contents

1. Vectors & Quantum State Descriptors 
1. The Particle In a Box Paradigm (PIB) & the Time Independent Schrodinger Equation
1. Observable Properties

*MatLab Work*

1. [Code For Investigating the Properties of PIB](/MLW1.md) (Week 1)
1. [Code For Defining The KE Matrix For PIB](/MLW2.md) (Week 2) 
1. [Code For Investigating the PIB via TISE](/MLW3a.md) (Week 3)
    1.  [Code arranging eigenvalues in ascending order](/MLW3b.md)
1. [Finalized TISE, PIB Code](/MLW4.md) (Week 4)

# Time Dependent Schrodinger Equation (TDSE)
  Background information provided for all time dependent Schrodinger equation inquiries can be found [here](/MasterTDSE.md). 
  We are also able to investigate multiple defined states in the following MatLab code: 
1. [Code For Creating A PIB In Accordance To TDSE](/MLW5.md) (Week 5)
1. [Code For Calculating The Expectation Value For TDSE PIB](/MLW6.md) (Week 6)
1. [Code For Calculating The First Two Expectation Values For TDSE PIB](/MLW6a.md) (Week 7) 
    1.  [Further modifying range of states explored](/MLW6c.md) 
    2.  Gaussian functions are often used to represent the probability density function of a normally distributed variable. We can apply 
        a Gaussian bump(s) in MatLab to our TDSE PIB to observe the [expectation value](/MLW6b.md) when we localize the particle to the right of the potential well.

# Perturbation Theory 
1. [Introduction to Pertubation Theory](/IntroPerturbation.md) (Week 8) 
    1.  [Re-Writing The TDSE To Consider Different Times](/MLW8.md) 
2. [Quantum Selection Rules](/Selection_Rules.md) (Week 9)
