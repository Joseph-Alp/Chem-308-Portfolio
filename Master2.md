# Observable Operators 

Observables take real values only. Therefore we must require that the operators that represent observables have only real eigenvalues, due to the fact that we want to identify the eigenvalues with the possible results of measurements. This can only be guaranteed if we only use Hermitean operators to represent observables. A Hermitian operator has real eigenvalues, and eigenvectors which form an orthonormalizable basis. This guarantees that predicted measurement results will be real values. Furthermore, wave functions expressed as a vector can be broken down into a linear combination of the basis vectors covering all space. As a result, we must adhere to the main principles of Hermetian operators:
1. Hermitean operators have real eigenvalues
1. The eigenfunctions of a Hermitean operator that belong to different eigenvalues are orthogonal
1. If a Hermitean operator is acting on a vector space V, there exists an orthogonal basis
of V made of eigenvectors


# Observable States Of Particle

The operator used for a PIB system determines the physical state of the particle. For instance, operating with the kinetic energy 
operator will generate information of the particle's KE at different states of energy. Furthermore, the average kinertic energy could be 
calculated by finding the expectation value, or simply the average, based on the possible states the particle may exist. 

# Changing Basis Sets 

Knowing how to convert a vector to a different basis has many practical applications throughout this course. A more indepth 
approach to changing bases can be found [here](/Bases.md).
