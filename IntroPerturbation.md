# Perturbation Theory

Pertubation Theory is a set of approximations related to the mathematical perturbation for describing a complicated quantum system in
terms of a simpler one. We can take this principle, and apply it to the work we have been doing for the PIB. For instance, a barrier
of finite height and width can be placed somewhere in the potential well. This tunnelling effect can be observed by looking at the
ensuing expectation values for energy and position. Similarly, we can observe the wave function's behavior with this finite barrier in place.
