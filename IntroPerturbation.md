# Perturbation Theory

Pertubation Theory is a set of approximations related to the mathematical perturbation for describing a complicated quantum system in
terms of a simpler one. We can take this principle, and apply it to the work we have been doing for the PIB. For instance, a barrier
of finite height and width can be placed somewhere in the potential well. This tunnelling effect can be observed by looking at the
ensuing expectation values for energy and position. Similarly, we can observe the wave function's behavior with this finite barrier in place.

One perspective we can take with Perturbation Theory in quantum mechanics is with molecular orbital theory. We can observe phase changes and inflections in the presence of a finite barrier seen [here](/Perturb.md), which can help us visualize bonding and anti-bonding interactions between diatomics.

Through the MatLab code mentioned above, we can explore the behavior of a particle interacting with both a right and left well by combining them into a central barrier.

Here, we are able to visualize the vectors from the right and left wells, that constitute the central well image, depicted below:

How does this help us to understand and visualize Perturbation Theory? 
* By picturing the contributions of both left and right wells, we can translate these depictions into something more practical, 
such as molecular orbitals 
* If we observe a diatomic, hydrogen compound, we can combine one electron from each atom to form a sigma orbital based on the constructive interference 
* Likewise, we can observe the anti-bonding orbital, in accordance to the desttructive interference between both orbitals 
* Thus, both left and right wells can tell us the contributions to the central barrier, which is the total net contribution between 
these molecular orbitals

The molecular orbital approach is one explanation for the H-H bond; this explanation is based on a mathematical model. In terms of wave mechanics, we can see that the two waves constructively interact. This is the foundation of our sigma bond, as it is a stabilizing interactio found at a lower energy than the anti-bonding counterpart. 

Similarly, we can look at the atomic orbitals of our diatomic hydrogen model. Here we see that each orbital accommodates two electrons, and the two electrons in H-H fills the sigma 1s molecular orbital. The result of this formation is an H2 molecule, where the energy of the system is lowered and more stable. Although this is a simplified diagram we have all learned since introductory chemistry, it is a simplified version of our quantum explanation about how these bonding interactions occur.
